# CurveTool

A tool to experiment on point interpolation and approximation.

## Interpolation

The tool allows to interpolate a set of points using different methods and parametrizations.
Click on the screen to add points and use the following keys to interact with the tool:

- `c` to clear the screen
- `p` to toggle the display of the polygon
- `f` to toggle functional interpolation
- `u` to toggle interpolation with a uniform parametrization
- `d` to toggle interpolation with a distance parametrization
- `r` to toggle interpolation with the root distance parametrization
- `t` to toggle interpolation with the Chebycheff parametrization

You can click on a point with the right mouse button to move it.

## Approximation

The tool allows visualize the Bezier curve of a set of points.
